# System-Analysis-and-Design

**Who was the client? What kind of system did they want to design?**

The client was a company named DriverPass. DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training. Our goal was to design a system that offers these clients' needs. 

**What did you do particularly well?**

I think I did particularly well in my system design document. I believe the UML diagrams were clear and easy to understand. In addition, I explained the technical requirements needed for the system to be completed, which is a necessary process.  

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would revise the business requirements document. To improve the paper, I would modify the nonfunctional and functional requirements sections. Although I provided a detailed description, both areas are still missing some vital information. In addition, there are times when I get confused identifying the difference between the two. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user’s needs by identifying what the client was trying to achieve and pinpointing who would use the product. After having the information, I implemented the user’s needs by creating different UML diagrams. Creating the diagrams gave me a clear picture of adding the user’s needs to the system. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing because these services are the main structure for the system to work correctly. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

Depending on the client’s needs, I would approach designing software differently. For example, in our DriverPass project, we first gather all the system’s functionalities and then create the UML diagrams to identify its classes or objects. For future strategies, I would follow a similar approach to the DriverPass system.
